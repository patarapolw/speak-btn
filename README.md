# speak-btn

Pluggable multi-lingual speak-button for both mobile and desktop

I made this from a rewrite of <https://github.com/patarapolw/s2speak>

## How this works

- [Normalization](https://github.com/patarapolw/speak-btn/blob/master/src/btn/index.ts#L20) of [web-speech-api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API/Using_the_Web_Speech_API) for both mobile and desktop.
- Iframe with `allowtransparency="true"`
